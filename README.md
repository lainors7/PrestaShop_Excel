# PrestaShop_Excel
Code to export Prodcuts and Combinations to xlsx

First stem, install PhpOffice (phpspreadsheet). I installed in Composer.
https://phpspreadsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

I made this code to export all current products in PrestaShop.
The code is very exlanatory, just read and understand.

Just copy the products.php or stock.php in your folder, and then, modify the "include" and "require" with the correct path to the file of PhpOffice and connection.php

This script will be perfect to offer to your users, a Master File with your current stock, prices and products.
